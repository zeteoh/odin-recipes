        <h5>
            Feta salad is a refreshing and vibrant dish that showcases the Mediterranean
             flavors and textures. This salad typically combines crisp and colorful 
             vegetables with the tangy richness of feta cheese, resulting in a delightful
              blend of tastes and textures. The star ingredient, feta cheese, is a crumbly and 
              salty cheese made from sheep's milk or a mixture of sheep's and goat's milk.
               Its distinct flavor pairs beautifully with the crispness of fresh vegetables 
               like cucumbers, tomatoes, and bell peppers. The salad is often dressed with a 
               zesty vinaigrette, featuring ingredients such as olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, 
               and herbs, which enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients. Feta salad is 
               not only a visually appealing dish but also a nutritious one, as it is packed 
               with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whether enjoyed as a light lunch or 
               a side dish, feta salad is a delicious way to embrace the vibrant flavors of 
               the Mediterranean.
